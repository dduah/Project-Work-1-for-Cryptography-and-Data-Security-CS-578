# Project-Work-1-for-Cryptography-and-Data-Security-CS-578
Conducted cryptanalysis of a modified ChaCha20 cipher (ChaC), identifying design and implementation flaws affecting security. Performed differential and linear analysis, developed a ChaC6 experimental variant, and evaluated diffusion, bias, and performance to assess cryptographic strength and research suitability
